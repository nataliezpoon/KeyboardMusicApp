# The Musical Circles Web App

### My own version of the addictingly joyful [Patatap](http://patatap.com/)!
Built as an optional class project in [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

### *Planning on making some fun tweaks to it soon :D*

This interactive collection of two dimensional animations that are triggered by sound is originally created by [jonobr1/Neuronal-Synchrony](https://github.com/jonobr1/Neuronal-Synchrony).
